      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Basically, when you sign in to Nodebook, our server redirects your browser to Google, where we authiticate your identity. This means that google tells us that you are in fact the person that you say you are. Google's servers passes your email, and the name associated with your email to our servers. That's it. Then our servers store several "cookies" on your computer so we remember you as you use Nodebook.</p>
      <p>Once you're sign in to Nodebook, if you don't have an account we create one. This means we store your email, and name. At any time you can log into Nodebook and delete your account. Doing such will also delete any information you stored on your account. </p>
      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>On the whole, we only collect the personal information that you give us. This also means that you're responsible for the legality of the data that you give us, and should only upload data that you are the owner of. If you didn't write it, you shouldn't be uploading it. If you don't own a particular photo, you shouldn't be uploading it. This applies to everything you do on Nodebook. In summation, don't use Nodebook for illegal stuff.</p>
      <p>When you enter a "node" or a piece of text, we store that in our databse. When you create a "graph" we store that in our database. These are pretty much the only types of data that we associate with your Nodebook user profile (you're name and email.) In order to best determine how people use Nodebook, we also gather statistics, and feedback, both of which are gathered anonymously. For example, we might gather data about how long a someone uses the site, where they click on the screen, or how often they're using a particular feature. At no time during their visit, are we associating any of this with a specific user profile. Also, there is an anyonymous feedback form in the user interface through which users can give feedback about the application. As the name implies, feedback is submitted anonymously. We don't log your name, and we don't log your email address when you give us feedback.</p>

      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Some online services are free, but make money by analyzing, and selling the data you give. We don't do that. Since this is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta">"Beta release,"</a> meaning the product is not complete, will have bugs in it and is intended for live user testing, we are not doing anything with the your data, other than the normal application functions. We're interested in looking at how you use the application, and whether it's of any use.</p>
      <p>If you're younger than 18 you are prohibited from using Nodebook. Please leave. If you're not, great, Keep reading!</p>
      
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>We don't sell your data, and we don't share it. That might change in the future, so check this agreement in the future. Nodebook has pretty good security, but, like any online service, isn't perfect. That being said, we do our best to make sure the data you give us is privay, and secure. Since Nodebook doesn't keep passwords, you don't need to worry about your password leaking out.</p>
      <hr />
      <h1>Other Information</h1>
      <p>This policy will change occasionally as the application advances, so you should check accordingly.</p>
