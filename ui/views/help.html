    <p><strong>Node:</strong> A node is a piece of text that can be as short as a tweet or as long as several pages. It is represented on the graph as a dot.</p>
    <p><strong>Connection:</strong> A connection represents the words that two nodes have in common. The heavier, darker, or thicker the connection, the more words those nodes have in common.</p>
    <p><strong>Graph:</strong> A graph is simply a group of nodes, that may or may not have connections. "Keywords" are what determines what nodes are added to a graph. For example, if you have the word 'City' used in a node, and listed as a keyword for a graph, then that node will show up when you view the graph.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>Node Actions:</h4>
    <p><strong>Viewing a Node:</strong> If you click a node on the graph, the sidebar on the left will automaticall scroll to that node. Inversely, if you click on a node's text, the node will be highlighted on the graph.</p>
    <p><strong>Adding a Node:</strong> To add a node click the button "New Node" in the top bar.</p>
    <p><strong>Editing a Node:</strong> Find the node in the sidebar and click "Edit Node." Note: Editing a node will cause it's connections to change.</p>
    <p><strong>Deleting a Node:</strong> Find the node in the sidebar and click "Edit Node." On the pop-up you will see a button to delete the node. Node: deleting a node will delete its connections, because you can't have a connection to a node that does not exist anymore.</p>
    <p><strong>Compare Two Nodes:</strong> Select one node on the graph by clicking it. Then hold the 'shift' key and select another one.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4>Graph Actions:</h4>
    <p><strong>Creating a Graph:</strong> In the "Graphs" drop down menu on the top bar select "Create Graph." Enter in a graph name, select a graph color, and enter in some keywords. Based upon what keywords you enter, different nodes will be added to that graph. For example, if you enter in the words 'science, technology, architecture' then any node that contains any of those words will be added to that graph.</p>
    <p><strong>Adding a Node to a Graph:</strong> Nodes will automatically be added to a graph if they contain one of the graph's keywords. If you want to force a Node with no common keywords into a graph, you can do so by finding the node in the sidebar and clicking the dropdown menu labeled "Add to graph."</p>
    <p><strong>Viewing a Graph:</strong> In the "Graphs" drop down menu on the top bar select the graph you want to view.</p>
    <p><strong>Viewing All Graphs:</strong> In the "Graphs" drop down menu on the top bar select "Overview."</p>
